<p>Gradients displays the combination of two or more colors.</p>

<h3>CSS3 defines two types of gradients:</h3>

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)<br>
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)<br>

<h4>Linear gradients</h4>
Linear gradients are used to arrange two or more colors in linear formats like top to bottom

<h4>Radial gradients</h4>
Radial gradients appears at center

<h3>Need for this standard:</h3>

<p>Earlier, you had to use images for these effects. However, by using CSS3 gradients you can reduce download time and bandwidth usage. In addition, elements with gradients look better when zoomed, because the gradient is generated by the browser.</p>

<h3>Negative Impact:</h3>
You may combine any number of functions to manipulate the rendering, but order still matters (i.e., using grayscale() after sepia() will result in completely gray output).
