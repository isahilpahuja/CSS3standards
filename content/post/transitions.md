<p>CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. For example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous. With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.</p>


The different transition properties are:

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>transition-property</td>
  <td>The ‘transition-property’ property specifies the name of the CSS property to which the transition is applied.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>transition-duration</td>
  <td>The ‘transition-duration’ property defines the length of time that a transition takes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>transition-timing-function</td>
  <td>The ‘transition-timing-function’ property describes how the intermediate values used during a transition will be calculated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>transition-delay</td>
  <td>The ‘transition-delay’ property defines when the transition will start. It allows a transition to begin execution some some period of time from when it is applied.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>transition</td>
  <td>The ‘transition’ shorthand property combines the four properties described above into a single property.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Need for this standard:</h3>

<p>The filter property used for graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders</p>

<h3>Negative Impact:</h3>
You may combine any number of functions to manipulate the rendering, but order still matters (i.e., using grayscale() after sepia() will result in completely gray output).
